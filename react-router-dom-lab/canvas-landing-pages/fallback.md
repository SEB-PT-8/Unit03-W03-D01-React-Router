## About

Welcome to Reactville, a constantly evolving virtual metropolis. Let's build this digital town together, one component at a time.

Welcome to Reactville's local post office! In this lab, you'll develop an application that simulates the management of post office boxes. Features will include creating new mailboxes, viewing a list of all mailboxes, and exploring individual mailbox details.

![Solution UI Example](../assets/solution-ui-1.png)

Throughout the lab, you'll use client-side routing tools from the React Router library to navigate between different components. This approach allows your single-page application to function more like a traditional multi-page website, improving the user experience by providing distinct navigable pages without full page reloads.
